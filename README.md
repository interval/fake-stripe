# fake-stripe

This package is designed to be used in conjunction with [Interval](https://interval.com) tutorials. In those tutorials, it serves as a drop-in replacement for [Stripe's Node.js SDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node), allowing the tutorials to be completed without a real Stripe account.

This package only intends to mock the methods required for our tutorials. It probably will never include mocks for all or even _most_ of Stripe's API methods.
